# DND-ML-Project

This is an ongoing project where i take the homebrew races from the dndwiki and attempt to classify them into their respective types on the wiki.

The data is in a really hard format extract a lot of useful information from it so for the time being the testing accuracies arent great but there is hope with the high test set accuracy of the neural network.

This project attempts to showcase skills in machine learning by showing proficiency in handling data that is very hard to use and making the best on it and being able to then apply ML methods to create a functioning model.

As i said this is an ongoing project so I hope to keep improving this but for the time being I want to focus on other projects and will come back to this later
